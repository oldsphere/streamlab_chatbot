Streamlab Chatbot Emulator
================================================================================

In order to make Streamlab chatbot more useful I find interesting to have a
emulator of its behavior to debug and test the diferent scripts.

In order to do so the documention provided by AhnkHeart was used:
https://github.com/AnkhHeart/Streamlabs-Chatbot-Python-Boilerplate/wiki

Additionally a bunch of scripts developed by Bare7a were used to test the
correct behavior of the emulator.

* First steps tries to emulate the main behaviors of `Parent`
* The proper modelling of `Data` structure is algo important to be able to test
  the behavior.
* The integration on the Streamlab Chatbot is out of the scope.

Future developments:
* I found interesting the idea of feeding the bot with logged conversation to
  check its beheaviour.
